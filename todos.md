# ToDos
- [ ] requirements
- [ ] sync mode: read blocks from chosen device
- [] async mode: pad last block (the length is currently != net input)

## Very far off in the future
- [ ] GUI: sync mode audio source selection (which app is the audio coming from?)
- [ ] audio: rework pipeline for streams to set streamer SR to system one <--- seems to be a pain in the ass and ultimately unneeded
